				<p>Hi there, thanks for stopping by.  I’m Ben Wolfe.  Officially, I am a mechanical engineering graduate who is currently pursing a second degree in computer science.  A more apt description, is that I am simply someone who lives for innovative technology, elegant design, and revolutionary products!</p>
				<br>
				<p>From an early age, I have loved technology — I distinctly remember the moment I bought my first iMac desktop.  I was 12 years old and was absolutely bewildered by the fact that so much power and possibility could fit in one sleek enclosure.  My goal is to bring this same feeling of awe to the end consumer on any project I touch.</p>
				<br>
				<p>My fascination for how the world works is what drove me to start my post-secondary education with mechanical engineering.  Nowadays, I spend most of my time programming.  I am happiest when working on development for projects with mechanical and software integration.  I am excited most by pushing limits and designing elegant solutions to complex problems.</p>
